				<p>Upstate Indie, LLC is an independant development studio with a strong passion for creating games and helping others meet their potential. At Upstate Indie we've cultivated our vision over decades of gaming. Perhaps all of that time wasn't wasted after all! We don't just make games, we enjoy the fun of playing them too!<br>      
				<br>
				We enjoyed developing with the MIT-licensed Open Source version of <a href="https://torque3d.org/" target="_blank">Torque3D</a> game engine for a number of years. During this time we honed our skillset around the usage of the engine, gaining invaluable insights into game development that were hard-earned by years of hands on coding and research.<br>
				<br>
				More recently we have transitioned our workflow to utilize the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> engine. As per our core values, we are always innovating to improve our standards for excellence.</p>
