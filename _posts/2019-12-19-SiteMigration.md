We recently migrated our site to a new IP. Following this migration, our Disqus widget wasn't operating as it should. Recommendations, comments, and so on were not properly being updated or displayed. This issue has been alleviated, yet any of the existing recommendations were lost. Since there were only a few recommendations, this was much simpler than performing multiple steps to migrate a couple 'like' clicks. So we've wiped the slate clean and in the future all recommendations and comments should be displayed properly. Cheers!
