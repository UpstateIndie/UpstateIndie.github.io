We use Disqus to moderate our blog. The only information that Disqus provides to us is the number of comments or votes we have. We don't intend to collect any personal information from you, and the sole purpose of our blog is to share development experiences and tutorials. It's come to our attention, however, that Disqus does gather standard analytics data and thought it important to pass this information along to you. Here is our updated <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/terms/" target="_blank">Privacy Statement</a> and here is the <a href="https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy" target="_blank">Disqus Privacy Policy</a>. Thanks for understanding!
